Induction part: 
- Needs to take in base case/basis 
- Induction hypothesis (if any): Assume...for n=k
- Confirm that base case and IH are right, if not take that input again 
- If statements are right -> move on, true for n=k+1 
- Test for n=k+2 
- Conclusion: Statement is true for all values of n
